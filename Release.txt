= Turn 0.6

Turn 0.6 is now compatible with Test/Unit 2.0. 

A instance variable name change made between 1.x and 2.0 series
of test/unit prevent the Turn modified Testrunner from working
correctly.

Other than that this release is the same as the 0.5.1 release.

As of 0.5, Turn has some signifficant new features:

While Turn still provides the exact same functionality for running
tests via ruby or testrb as previous versions. The turn commandline 
utility has been completely rewritten with expanded capabilites. 

The turn command now features three run modes:

* Solo runner for running each test file in a separate process.
* Cross runner for running test file pairs in separate processes.
* Normal runner, which of course runs all test in a single process.

It also support three report modes:

* Progress reporter which uses a progress bar.
* Minimal reporter which provides traditional "dot" progress.
* Outline reporter populaized by turn.

The is also a special Marshal Mode which dumps test results as YAML.
And the underlying API makes it easy create new reporters.

To get a quick rundown on how to use the new commandline:

  $ turn --help

Enjoy!
